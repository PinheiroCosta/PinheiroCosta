<b>Hello</b> there, I'm Rômulo. Welcome to my profile!

> I'm a Software Developer at Canopus Informática. Aiding clients to maintain their code base clean and developing solutions since early 2021.

Here you will find free [tools](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/MyScripts) created by me. Most of them helped me get rid of repetitive tasks at some point in my life. They are not currently being maintained, so I expect you to use them at your own risk, but feel free to study or improve them if you wish. 

For proffessional purposes please contact me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinheirocosta/)  
Technical related issues and other subjects please consider sending me an email at: romulopinheirocosta@gmail.com or reaching me out on Discord: Rom#0160
