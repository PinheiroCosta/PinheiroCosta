 <b>Hello</b> there, I'm RÃ´mulo.  


Welcome to my Github profile. Here you may find some scripts to improve productivity with [GNU/Linux](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/MyScripts). I also create some [web stuff](https://codepen.io/pinheirocosta) for learning purposes, like these [Web Apps](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/react-apps). Some of my side projects includes a [Discord Bot](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/rombot) written in Python and the [Cnestesia](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/cnestesia), where I'm trying to figure out a way to 'see' the sound.
