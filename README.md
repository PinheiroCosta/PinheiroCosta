Here you will find free [tools](https://github.com/PinheiroCosta/MyScripts) created by me. Most of them helped me get rid of repetitive tasks at some point of my life. They are not currently being maintained, so i expect you at least to have some degree of understanding what you're doing, and to use them at your own risk.
